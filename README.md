# VR-RPG-Mechanics
Game mechanics for different fighting styles for a future VR RPG game

Currently contains movement mechanics (moving, jumping, dash backwards), turning mechanics (headset, snapturn) and hand animations/movement (hand tracking, fist, point, open hand). There is also an animated dragon asset for use of testing the fighting mechanics on with a health bar. Although the dragon does breathe fire, damage to the player has not yet been implemented.

SPELLCASTING:

Also included is a POC of the spellcasting which involves drawing symbols (runes) in the air to generate the spell, and then activating it somehow. Currently there are two spells, a ball spawner (for testing) and a fireball spell. Spells are activated by holding the grip and trigger at the same time and drawing a symbol.

Ball spawner: Draw an O shape and release the trigger to spawn a ball which falls to the ground.
Fireball: Draw a ^ symbol (hat shape -> /\) and release the trigger to generate the fireball. Punch the fireball whilst holding the grip button to fire it at a target.
